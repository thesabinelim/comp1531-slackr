Team meetings:
    - Conducted primarily on Facebook Messenger, in a group chat. Timings were
      flexible and generally whenever an issue needed to be discussed it was
      just brought up immediately on the group chat, mentioning the relevant
      people so that they would get a notification and see the message.
    - One team meeting was held on Thursday the 3rd of October, during the lab
      time. The meeting's purpose was to ensure everyone was set for the Sunday
      deadline, and that everyone was on the same page regarding writing tests.

Allocation of responsibilities:
    - User stories were written initially by Sabine, but all group members
      pitched in with ideas. Eric helped organise the user stories into
      categories to be turned into epics afterwards.
    - auth and channel/channels tests and stubs were written by Sabine.
    - message and user_profile tests and stubs were written by Bridget.
    - standup tests and stubs were written by Jake.
    - search tests and stubs were written by Eric.
    - admin tests and stubs were written by Jiacheng.

Areas for improvement:
    - Cohesion: we should start working after team members reach a consensus. It
      would save time and avoid conflicts.
    - Time management: some members have commitments that prevented them from
      contributing as much this iteration.
